To install pip
1.     Use the curl command to download the installation script. The following command uses the -O (uppercase "O") parameter to specify that the downloaded file is to be stored in the current folder using the same name it has on the remote host.
$ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
 
2.     Run the script with Python to download and install the latest version of pip and other required support packages.
$ python get-pip.py --user
Or use the following.
$ python3 get-pip.py --user
When you include the --user switch, the script installs pip to the path ~/.local/bin.
 
3.     Ensure the folder that contains pip is part of your PATH variable.
1. 	Find your shell's profile script in your user folder. If you're not sure which shell you have, run echo $SHELL.
2. 	$ ls -a ~
.  ..  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  Desktop  Documents  Downloads
·   	Bash – .bash_profile, .profile, or .bash_login
·   	Zsh – .zshrc
·   	Tcsh – .tcshrc, .cshrc or .login
3. 	Add an export command at the end of your profile script that's similar to the following example.
export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
This command inserts the path, ~/.local/bin in this example, at the front of the existing PATH variable.
4. 	Reload the profile into your current session to put those changes into effect.
$ source ~/.bash_profile
 
4.     Now you can test to verify that pip is installed correctly.
$ pip --version
pip 19.2.3 from ~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (python 3.7)
Install the AWS CLI version 1 with pip
Use pip to install the AWS CLI.
$ pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user
When you use the --user switch, pip installs the AWS CLI to ~/.local/bin.
Verify that the AWS CLI installed correctly.
$ aws --version
aws-cli/1.16.273 Python/3.7.3 Linux/4.14.133-113.105.amzn2.x86_64 botocore/1.13.0
 
To install or upgrade eksctl on Linux using curl
1.     Download and extract the latest release of eksctl with the following command.
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/download/latest_release/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp
 
2.     Move the extracted binary to /usr/local/bin.
sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin
 
3.     Test that your installation was successful with the following command.
eksctl version
Note
The GitTag version should be at least 0.11.0. If not, check your terminal output for any installation or upgrade errors.
To install kubectl on Linux
1.     Download the Amazon EKS-vended kubectl binary for your cluster's Kubernetes version from Amazon S3:
·       Kubernetes 1.14:
curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.14.6/2019-08-22/bin/linux/amd64
 1.     Apply execute permissions to the binary.
chmod +x ./kubectl
 
2.     Copy the binary to a folder in your PATH. If you have already installed a version of kubectl, then we recommend creating a $HOME/bin/kubectl and ensuring that $HOME/bin comes first in your $PATH.
 
mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./kubectl $HOME/bin/kubectl && export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
 
3.     (Optional) Add the $HOME/bin path to your shell initialization file so that it is configured when you open a shell.
Note
This step assumes you are using the Bash shell; if you are using another shell, change the command to use your specific shell initialization file.
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
 4.     After you install kubectl, you can verify its version with the following command:
kubectl version --short --client
Installing aws-iam-authenticator
Download the Amazon EKS-vended aws-iam-authenticator binary from Amazon S3:
curl -o aws-iam-authenticator https://amazon-eks.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.14.6/2019-08-22/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator
Apply execute permissions to the binary.
chmod +x ./aws-iam-authenticator
Copy the binary to a folder in your $PATH. We recommend creating a $HOME/bin/aws-iam-authenticator and ensuring that $HOME/bin comes first in your $PATH.
mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./aws-iam-authenticator $HOME/bin/aws-iam-authenticator && export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
Add $HOME/bin to your PATH environment variable.
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
Test that the aws-iam-authenticator binary works.
